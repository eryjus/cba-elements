***CBA-Elements***

This project is an implementation of a C++ program that can interact with a MySQL database.  Besides learning an efficient resable way to interact with the database, the other goal is to explore how to Write an MVC applicaiton in C++ (Model, View, Controller).

For more information about MVC, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller


**The Model**

So, the model is the data and all the logic that will operate on that data.  This will include the database access layer.


**The View**

**The Controller**

***Tools***

**Database Modeler**

I am using the following web site to perform the database modeling work.  This site is: https://sqldbm.com/en/Home/

As a result, I am able to model the database graphically and even generate SQL code to create the tables.  However, the functions of reading and maintaining the resulting data will be mine to manage in code.
